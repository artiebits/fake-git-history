# Generate Git Commits

A command-line tool that generates GitHub or GitLab activity graphs to make it look like you have been coding regularly.

## How To Use

1. Ensure you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and
   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed on your machine.
2. Generate your commits:
   ```shell script
   npx fake-git-history
   ```
3. Create [a private repository](https://github.com/new) called `my-history` in your GitHub or GitLab.
4. Push the changes:
   ```shell script
   cd my-history
   git remote add origin git@github.com:<USERNAME>/my-history.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

Done! Now take a look at your GitHub profile 😉

## Customizations

### `--preview`

If you want to preview the activity graph before creating any commits, use the `--preview` flag:

```shell script
npx fake-git-history --preview
```

You can combine it with other options:

```shell script
npx fake-git-history --preview --distribution workHours --frequency 100
```

### `--frequency`

Control the chance (0-100%) of generating commits for each day. This makes your activity graph look more random and realistic.
The default value is `80`, which means commits will be generated for 80% of the days in the date range. Setting a lower value will randomly skip more days:

```shell script
npx fake-git-history --frequency 50
```

This will generate commits for approximately 50% of the days in your date range, making the pattern look more natural.

### `--distribution`

Choose the distribution pattern for generating commits:

- `uniform` (default): Evenly distributed random commits between min and max
- `workHours`: More commits during work hours (9am-5pm) and on weekdays (especially Tuesday-Thursday)
- `afterWork`: More commits during evenings and weekends

#### Work Hours Pattern

For a typical work schedule pattern that shows more activity during weekdays:

```shell script
npx fake-git-history --distribution workHours --preview
```

Days between Tuesday and Thursday will have the most activity, while weekends will be mostly empty.

#### After Work Pattern

For an evening/weekend coder pattern that shows more activity during off-hours:

```shell script
npx fake-git-history --distribution afterWork --preview
```

Saturday and Sunday will have the most activity, with Friday evenings also showing higher commit counts.

### `--startDate` and `--endDate`

By default, the script generates GitHub commits for every day within the last year.
But if you want to generate activity for specific dates, use these options:

```shell script
npx fake-git-history --startDate "2020/09/01" --endDate "2020/09/30"
```

### `--commitsPerDay`

Specify the number of commits to create for each day.
The default is `0,4`,but you can change it:

```shell script
npx fake-git-history --commitsPerDay "0,6"
```

## PS

This tool was created as a joke, so please don't take it seriously. While cheating is never encouraged, if someone is judging your professional skills based on your GitHub activity graph, they deserve to see a rich activity graph 🤓
